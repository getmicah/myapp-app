# spotify-recs-app

front end for ~~[spotify-recs.github.io](https://spotify-recs.github.io)~~ (Offline for now. Can't afford [api](https://github.com/spotify-recs/api) server costs at the moment :p)

To test locally:

* edit `/src/utils/config.ts` to include `/config/config.local.json`
* start a local go server on port `3000`
* `yarn start`
* open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
